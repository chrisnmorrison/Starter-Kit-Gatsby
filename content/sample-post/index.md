This is the way a new universe is supposed to work, or at least, how the universe has to work, if it is supposed to.

If all the things in the universe (like every single cell, tree, galaxy, star, planet, etc.) can only be understood if you accept that they were created in some very particular manner, then there is no logical possibility to think that they created at all. If you think about it, we’ve found out a whole lot about the universe (and every single part of it), and we can’t accept anything as fact unless there is a logical reason for it.

You can’t say ‘it’ created out of nothing until you’ve measured something, or figured out the speed of light and the mass of the sun and the mass of matter that they’re all made of, etc – at that point all we say is ‘something’ creates stuff (and it only works for one case; it can’t be true for every case, since it’s impossible to know what might or might not have happened). So then we either have to accept that everything in [nature is random](https://typer.seventhqueen.com/publisher/the-balance-of-nature/#), or if that’s the case, we just don’t expect the universe to continue to be random.
