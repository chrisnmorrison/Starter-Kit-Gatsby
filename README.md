# Starter-Kit-Gatsby
 
This starter kit is based on [Oak Harbor Web Design's Starter Kit](https://github.com/Oak-Harbor-Kits/Starter-KitV3), with several major changes.

- Turned all components into Gatsby + React Components.
- Convert images to Gatsby Images, which optimize and generate fallback images automatically.
- Add PurgeCSS to build pipeline.
- Improve SEO by utilizing React Helmet (a few TODO's here still)
