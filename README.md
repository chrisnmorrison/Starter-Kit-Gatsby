# Gatsby Small Business Starter Kit

This website is based on the [template kit by Oak Harbor Web Designs](https://github.com/Oak-Harbor-Kits/Starter-Kit-V2), and contains a full design for an imaginary landscaping company.

It is fully statically generated, both the pages and the blog, using Gatsby and NetlifyCMS.

**Note:** This project uses [Gatsby v4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-4/).

## Getting Started (Without Netlify)

```
$ Fork this repo and clone to your local machine
