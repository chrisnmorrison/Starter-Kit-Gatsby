# Contributing to Open Education

:tada: Thank you so much for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Open Education. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Open Education is a very straightforward project, so we plan on keeping our contributing guidelines simple. There are two types of contributions: no-code submissions, and code submissions. Both are very important to us!

## Code of Conduct


## I Have a Quick Question / Concern

For quick questions/concerns, there are two preferred options:
- Our subreddit: [Click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/openeducation/)
- Email us: [opendotone@gmail.com](mailto:opendotone@gmail.com)

## Types of Contributions

Please note that for both types of contributions, [Git and Github](https://github.com/opendotone/openeducation) is the primary submission type. For code contributions, we only accept Github pull requests. For non-code contributions, we are open to accepting other forms of contributions, such as documents sent to [our email](mailto:opendotone@gmail.com). We'll talk more about that in the following section!

If you aren't familiar with Git or Github, it's (fairly) easy to learn! Our Git workout is very simple, so you really only need to know: common Git commands, general Github workflow, issues, and pull requests. [This video covers the basics of how to contribute to an open source project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbqSvJs-6W4), and [this video goes more depth into Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk). We highly recommend both, so that you feel comfortable contributing!

### No-Code Contributions

No-code contributions include:
- New Article submissions
- Editing articles (adding content, grammar fixes, broken links, etc.)
- Recommendations and discussions on our page content, such as our [About Us](https://openeducation.one/about) page.

If you would like to contribute, please open an issue on Github. If you aren't quite sure how to do this, take a look at some of the other issues to get an idea! No matter what, open the issue, and if it needs more info, we'll let you know.

For no-code submissions, we also accept email submissions (for those who are less tech savvy, or who aren't interested in using Git). Just sent us a PDF or Word document with the information we need, and one of the maintainers will publish it!
